/*! \defgroup systemErrorLogMessageTypes System Error Log Message Types
There are four types of log entries. In the preference dialog, the user can select what
types of log entries they want to be generated. This is how users control the
verbosity of the log file in some meaningful way. Developers are encouraged to be very
verbose about information and debug messages -- the Log() functions should be used to
record any events out of the ordinary. As the user can elect to ignore these messages they
are perfect for troubleshooting. The values can be OR'd together.

SYSLOG_DEBUG messages are also always sent to the debugger output using DebugPrint()

/*! \brief Class for writing out log information to a file.
\remarks MAX maintains a log file that contains the text of error / warning /
information / debug messages generated by the system and plug-ins. This class
is used to work with the log and send messages to it. The log file is placed in
the Network directory and is called Max.Log. To access this
facility from anywhere in MAX use the pointer returned fro the method
Interface::Log(). All methods of this class are implemented by the
system.
