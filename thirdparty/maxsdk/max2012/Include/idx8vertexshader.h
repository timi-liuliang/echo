\par Description:
This class is available in release 4.0 and later only.\n\n
The abstract interface to the Direct-3D Vertex Shader architecture.\n\n
The drawing functions are necessary as something other than a simple default
body if: <ul> <li>The VertexShader needs to add additional per vertex data
unknown to the Mesh to the VertexBuffer. </li> <li>The VertexShader needs to
have per vertex data ordered differently than the standard position, normal,
{color, tex coords ordering}. </li> <li>The VertexShader is being used to
create cached VertexBuffers or using higher order surfaces. </li> </ul> \n In the
cases of <b>DrawMeshStrips()</b> and <b>DrawWireMesh()</b>, the VertexShader
has the option of not only locking and filling the VertexBuffer with data, but
also of making the actual DrawPrimitive call. In the case of
<b>StartLines()</b>, the VertexShader must make the DrawPrimitive call. The
VertexShader indicates that it has done the drawing by returning 'true' in the
Draw functions provided.\n\n
In the case where the VertexShader does not want to do the drawing but does
want to fill in a VertexBuffer with data, the VertexShader can request the GFX
to create a VertexBuffer (and possibly an IndexBuffer) of appropriate size. The
GetVertexBuffer and GetIndexBuffer calls on the ID3DGraphicsWindow object will
do this and return the allocated buffers in subsequent calls or reallocate them
if necessary.\n\n
Please note that if a PixelShader or PixelShaders are in use, these Draw
functions may need to set them for the appropriate passes of a multipass
rendering if the drawing is done in these Draw() functions. If the GFX is doing
the drawing, then these Draw() functions are only being used to fill in the
VertexBuffer with data; the GFX will be doing the drawing and will be setting
the PixelShaders as appropriate.  */
